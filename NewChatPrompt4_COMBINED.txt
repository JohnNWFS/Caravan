I'm uploading a complete snapshot of my GameMaker Studio trading caravan game. The snapshot includes code (objects, scripts, events) and a DESIGN.md document outlining intended features.

**Your task: Perform a complete project health analysis in three phases.**

## PHASE 1: MEMORY REFRESH & ARCHITECTURE
Build a complete understanding of the codebase:
- Map all objects and their responsibilities
- Catalog all scripts with signatures and purposes  
- Document data structures (player, world, economy, inventory)
- Trace game flow and initialization sequence

## PHASE 2: DESIGN ALIGNMENT CHECK
Compare implemented code against DESIGN.md:
- ✅ Verify features marked complete are actually implemented
- ⚠️ Identify partial implementations or discrepancies
- 🆕 Find implemented features not in design doc
- 📝 Suggest specific DESIGN.md updates

## PHASE 3: CODE HEALTH ANALYSIS
Identify technical debt and inefficiencies:
- **Orphaned scripts** (never called anywhere)
- **Redundant functions** (duplicate implementations)
- **Incomplete migrations** (half-finished refactoring)
- **Unused data structures** (created but never read)
- **Architectural inefficiencies** (over-complicated solutions)
- **Naming inconsistencies** (mixed conventions)

**Output format:**
