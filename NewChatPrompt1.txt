I'm uploading a complete snapshot of my GameMaker Studio trading caravan game project. This file contains all objects, scripts, events, and project configuration.

**Your task: Perform a comprehensive memory refresh and provide an architectural overview.**

Please analyze the snapshot and provide:

1. **ARCHITECTURAL MAP**
   - Core persistent objects and their responsibilities
   - Object interaction flow (which objects communicate with which)
   - Event sequence (what happens on game start, during step, on draw)
   - Global data structures and their purposes

2. **OBJECT INVENTORY**
   For each object, document:
   - Object name and core purpose
   - Events implemented (Create, Step, Draw, etc.) with brief descriptions
   - Key variables/structs it manages
   - Dependencies (what other objects/scripts it relies on)

3. **SCRIPT CATALOG**
   For each script, provide:
   - Function name and signature (parameters)
   - Purpose in one sentence
   - Return value (if any)
   - Which objects/scripts call this function
   - Related scripts (what it works with)

4. **DATA STRUCTURE MAP**
   Document the key data structures:
   - Player/caravan data structure
   - World/location data structure
   - Economy/market data structure
   - Inventory/slot system structure
   - Any other major nested structs

5. **GAME FLOW**
   - Initialization sequence (what happens first)
   - Main game loop (step-by-step)
   - Command processing flow
   - State transitions

**Output format:**
- Use clear hierarchical organization
- Use code blocks for struct definitions
- Highlight architectural decisions
- Focus on WHAT EXISTS, not speculation about what could be added
- Note any obvious gaps or incomplete implementations

After this analysis, I'll be ready to work on extending specific systems or debugging issues. This serves as your refreshed memory of the project state.
