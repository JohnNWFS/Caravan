I have a DESIGN.md document that outlines the intended features, systems, and architecture for my trading caravan game. You've already analyzed the current codebase snapshot.

**Your task: Compare the implemented code against the design document and identify discrepancies.**

Please provide:

1. **IMPLEMENTATION STATUS VERIFICATION**
   Compare the "Current Implementation Status" section in DESIGN.md against actual code:
   - ✅ Features marked complete that ARE implemented correctly
   - ⚠️ Features marked complete but PARTIALLY implemented or buggy
   - ❌ Features marked complete but NOT FOUND in code
   - 🆕 Features IMPLEMENTED but not documented in DESIGN.md

2. **DESIGN DRIFT ANALYSIS**
   Identify where code diverges from design:
   - Systems implemented differently than designed
   - New patterns or approaches not in design doc
   - Abandoned design concepts (in doc but not coded)
   - Better alternatives discovered during implementation

3. **DESIGN DOC UPDATE RECOMMENDATIONS**
   Suggest specific updates to DESIGN.md:
   - Move features from "Not Yet Implemented" to "Completed"
   - Update "Partially Implemented" statuses
   - Document new implementation decisions
   - Remove/archive abandoned concepts
   - Add discovered patterns to "Design Decisions & Rationale"

4. **MISSING DESIGN DOCUMENTATION**
   Identify implemented systems that need design documentation:
   - New scripts/systems not mentioned in DESIGN.md
   - Implementation details that should be documented
   - Design decisions that should be captured

**Output format:**
- Use clear sections with ✅⚠️❌🆕 markers
- Quote specific sections from DESIGN.md when referencing
- Provide specific line-item updates for the design doc
- Prioritize: Critical mismatches first, minor documentation gaps last

**Goal:** Ensure DESIGN.md accurately reflects what's actually built, and identify any implementation that contradicts intended design.

[Note: You already have the code snapshot from Prompt 1. DESIGN.md is included in the snapshot.]
