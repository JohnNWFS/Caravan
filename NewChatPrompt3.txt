You've analyzed my codebase and understand the architecture. Now I need a code health check.

**Your task: Identify orphaned code, redundant implementations, and architectural inefficiencies.**

Please analyze and report:

1. **ORPHANED SCRIPTS**
   Find scripts that are never called:
   - Script name
   - Where it SHOULD be called (if obvious)
   - Whether it's dead code or incomplete implementation
   - Recommendation: DELETE or INTEGRATE?

2. **REDUNDANT FUNCTIONS**
   Find duplicate or near-duplicate implementations:
   - Function/script names that do the same thing
   - Percentage of code overlap
   - Which one is better/more complete
   - Recommendation: MERGE, DEPRECATE one, or SPECIALIZE both?

3. **INCOMPLETE MIGRATIONS**
   Find evidence of refactoring that wasn't finished:
   - Old and new versions of same system
   - Half-updated function calls
   - Deprecated patterns still in use
   - Mixed naming conventions (old vs new)

4. **UNUSED VARIABLES/STRUCTS**
   Find data structures that are created but never read:
   - Variable/struct name and location
   - Where it's created
   - Whether it's truly unused or just not yet used
   - Recommendation: REMOVE or COMPLETE feature?



5. **ARCHITECTURAL INEFFICIENCIES**
   Find structural issues:
   - Functions that should be combined
   - Repeated code blocks that should be extracted
   - Over-complicated implementations with simpler alternatives
   - Data passed through multiple layers unnecessarily

6. **NAMING INCONSISTENCIES**
   Find patterns that violate the codebase conventions:
   - Mixed naming styles (scr_ vs cmd_ vs no prefix)
   - Similar functions with different naming patterns
   - Recommendation for standardization

**Detection methodology:**
- Cross-reference all script definitions with all script calls
- Look for similar function names (scr_get_X vs scr_fetch_X)
- Compare code blocks for structural similarity
- Check variable assignments vs. variable reads
- Analyze comment TODO/FIXME/HACK markers

**Output format:**
